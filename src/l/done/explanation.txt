The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) applies to inheritance hierarchies,
specifying that you should design your classes so that client dependencies can be substituted
with subclasses without the client knowing about the change.

We have created the class Pay - the base class and the other
classes implement this class method's and properties but also conform its behaviour
